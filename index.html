              RMIT's bachelor of Geospatial science is revered amongst all of Australia and
              slowly and steadily the world. It has lots of connections within the industry
              and helped me get a very solid grasp of spatial and data analysis. I
              graduated with a WAM of 71 and a GPA of 3.0.

                Specializations
              </span>
              <ul>
                <li>The course offers a wide range of avenues from surveying
                  to photogrammetry, to Remote sensing and more. My main
                  focus and interest though was with GIS, (Geographic
                  Information System) which focuses on spatial and data analysis
                </li>

                <li>In a general sense I have had great success in being able to
                  find data, analyse what it means, cut it down to what I need
                  and then use it for a variety of purposes, such as road and
                  hotspot analysis, or map making.
                </li>

                <li>Through GIS I was very interested in road accidents and
                  Victoria’s goal of <a href="https://www.tac.vic.gov.au/road-safety/victorian-road-safety-strategy/towards-zero-2016-2020-road-safety-strategy"
                  target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">
                  <b>towards 0</b></a>. Through this interest I was able to analyse car
                  crashes and hotspots through three major projects were I
                  created and analysed road accident hotspots and their patterns.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <span class="resume-description-key">
                Key achievements
              </span>
              <ul>
                <li>My main achievement would be my work. Being able to produce
                  high quality analysis and then being able to produce a product
                  that shows the analyse is something I'm very proud of. Being
                  able to explain what I did and how I did it, is also a key
                  achievement as well, as explaining something so someone who
                  doesn't understand the project/work is something I'm always
                  trying to improve on.
                </li>
                <li>I'm constantly trying to improve my social skills, and
                  through the course I have been able to make strong progress on
                  this. I have been able to meet new people and work within
                  groups, writing joint reports or a group presentation. Being
                  able to do this has strengthen my social and public skills and
                  I hope to continue to do so wherever my career takes me.
                </li>
                <li>An achievement more focused on grades would be that I scored
                  very well in my spatial analysis classes. I was able to
                  achieve distinctions in all the courses with one High
                  Distinction in the last course based on spatial analysis.
