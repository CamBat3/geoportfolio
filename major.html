    <div class="resume-designation">During my final year of my studies, I was tasked with
      working on a year long project/thesis. I decided to continue my work of traffic accident
      hotspots from previous years and to do this I would expand on and fix issues with my
      previous work. I read a lot more literature about hotspot analysis especially Australian
      based and was able to learn a lot more and improve my methods. In previous years I had
      used a planar KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) which isn’t ideal for car accidents, so this
      time I was able to find a tool called SANET and was able to perform Network KDE (NKDE)
      which improved my results.</div>
      <br>
    <div class="resume-designation">This is still an ongoing project and is yet to be fully
      completed but bellow are some preliminary results that show, the combined peak-hours
      (Morning peak hour 7-9am, and Evening peak hour 4-7pm) from the years 2008-2018. The
      second video splits the two peak-hour periods up and again shows them from 2008-2018. My
      aim is to also show results that focus in on specific intersections, like Flinders and
      Swanston Street, and show the change over time. As mentioned, this project is far from
      complete and hopefully in the future I or someone else can dive into the why’s of this
      project and maybe even come up with solutions to mitigate crash accident hotspots.</div>
